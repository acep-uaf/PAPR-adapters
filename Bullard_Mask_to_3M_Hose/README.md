# Bullard Mask to 3M Hose
This plugs into the round 3M PAPR-side hose, and lets it connect to the bayonet-style Bullard mask/hood.

It allows you to use a Bullard mask/hood with a 3M Versaflow PAPR unit.

Because the round features on the 3M side are rather challenging to 3D print effectively, the "lathe_finished" directory includes extra material that is machined away.

The SLDPRT SolidWorks original was designed by Benjamin Loeffler <bhloeffler@alaska.edu>.  The CNC and 3D printing adaptations were designed by Dr. Orion Lawlor <lawlor@alaska.edu>.
